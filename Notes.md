PROCESS (MANDATORY)

You work in a strict loop:

After EACH meaningful UX/UI change:

1. Re-read ACCEPTANCE.md
2. List violated criteria (explicitly)
3. Fix them
4. Document reasoning in STATUS.md

STOP ONLY if:

* All acceptance criteria are met
* The tool feels IC-ready
* No obvious UX or structure improvements remain
