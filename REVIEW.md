# Review Log

Use this file to append findings and decisions after each iteration.

## Iteration 1
- Findings: Case bar lacked hierarchy; KPI blocks stacked vertically; driver deltas were hard to scan; wizard steps lacked focus guidance.
- Decisions: Rebuilt case bar layout with columns and action grouping; moved KPI blocks into columns; formatted driver deltas; added short step descriptions and impact preview context.

## Iteration 2
- Findings: Percent inputs displayed as decimals; planning tables were hard to scan; notes were absent for key drivers; KPIs lacked consistent grouping.
- Decisions: Added percent display conversion with safe parsing; reordered year tables to mimic Excel; added driver notes; grouped KPIs into columns with short table context.

## Iteration 3
- Findings: Quick and Advanced sections duplicated inputs, risking conflicting edits; advanced sections still felt heavy.
- Decisions: Removed duplicated controls, kept only long-tail fields in Advanced, and added section separators to reduce cognitive load.

## Iteration 4
- Findings: Planning sheets still felt visually dense with little separation between quick and advanced areas.
- Decisions: Added consistent separators after quick inputs to improve scanning and reduce clutter.

## Iteration 5
- Findings: Residual jargon in labels, missing read-only summaries on planning pages, and inconsistent unit/formatting cues for currency and Year 0.
- Decisions: Simplified labels to plain language, added read-only summary blocks on every input page, standardized € units with thousand separators, and made Year 0 visually distinct.

## Iteration 6
- Findings: Sidebar structure diverged from required IA, case controls were too visible outside settings, statements lacked grouping emphasis, and number formatting did not meet k€/m€ and % rules.
- Decisions: Rebuilt sidebar into sectioned radio nav, moved case management/export into settings pages, added statement section headers and total emphasis, standardized k€/m€ and percent display, and added Base Case auto-clone protection.
