## Mandatory Self-Review (must do before STOP)

Before declaring STOP you MUST:
1) Read ACCEPTANCE.md fully
2) Explicitly list which criteria are currently violated
3) Fix them
4) Repeat until ZERO violations remain

If unsure, assume the solution is NOT acceptable and improve it.

A task is ONLY done if:

App runs without errors
Manual smoke test of all affected pages passes
ACCEPTANCE.md has ZERO violations (explicitly checked)



## 1. Big Picture (Non-Negotiable)

This app is:
- An EARLY-PHASE decision model
- Built to pressure-test deals

## 2. Decision Priority Order (Descending)

Always optimize in this order:
1. Decision clarity for the user
2. Financial correctness & consistency
3. UX simplicity
4. Code cleanliness
5. Performance optimizations

Performance must NEVER override clarity or correctness.
